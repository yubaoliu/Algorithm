* ML Foundation
** Foundation Oriented ML Course
Story-like:

- When can machines learn?
- Why can machines learn?
- How can machines learn?
- How can machines learn better?

** From Learning to Machine Learning
> Learning

with experience accumulated from observations

observations ----> Learning ---> skill

> machine learning: acquiring skill
with experience accumulated/computed from data

data---> ML --->skill

> skill

improve some performance measure

data ---> ML ---> improved performance measure

An application computational finance:

stock data ---> ML ---> more investment gain

Yet Another Application: Tree Recognition

** Key Essence of Machine Learning
- exists some 'underlying patten' to be learned
  so 'performance measure' can be improved

- but no programmable definition
  so 'ML' needed

- somehow there is data about the pattern
  so ML has some inputs to learn from

** ML vs AI vs DM vs Statistics
*Machine Learning*: use data to compute hypothesis $g$ 
that approximates target $f$

*Artificial Intelligence*:
Compute something that shows intelligence behavior

ML is one possible route to realize AI

*Data Mining*:
use (huge) data to find property that is interesting

*Statistics*:
use data to make inference about an unknown process

statistics can be used to achieve ML

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
h(x) & = sign(\sum_{i=1}^{d}w_ix_i)-threshold)  \\
&    = sign(\sum_{i=1}^{d}w_ix_i)+(-threshold)(+1)) \\
&    = sign(\sum_{i=0}^{d}w_ix_i)                   \\
&    = sign(w^{T}X)                                 \\
