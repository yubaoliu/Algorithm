1. Left-handed coordinate system

The default coordinate system in the RenderMan(TM) Interface is left-handed: the positive x, y and z axes point right, up and forward, respectively. Positive rotation is *clockwise* about the axis of rotation.
 
2. Right-handed coordinate system

The default coordinate system in OpenGL(TM) is right-handed: the positive x and y axes point right and up, and the negative z axis points forward. Positive rotation is *counterclockwise* about the axis of rotation.
